# Instructions:

Survive a set amount of days and nights to win the game. 
Do this by defending yourself from robots with weapons that you can craft, and by crafting better armour.
Health or hunger, when fully depleted will cause the player to die so hunting the animals in the forest are essential to winning.
Crafting can be done when the crafting menu is enabled and that the player is close to the merchant.
Player controls are mappable to any key which the player wants to use.
